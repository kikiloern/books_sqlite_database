# kiki's "books_sqlite_database"
Using Python to track my books with SQlite

## Features
- Add books (title, author, date read, liked, boring, strong, notes etc.)
- View all books in your collection
- Simple, beginner-friendly Python and SQLite code

## Database
Creates a `books.db` SQLite database locally. By default, this file is ignored by git (`.gitignore`).

## Future ideas
- Add command-line options (add/book/view/remove)
- GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt
- Exporting books to CSV/JSON
